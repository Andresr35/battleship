### Project Descript

This project was created to demonstrate the use of Jest. During the process of each factory, a Jest test module was created to test out logic. After each of the tests passed, HTML and CSS were started to be implemented.

This project just shows how to use Jest, while running some common configuration such as Webpack, Babel, and Eslint. On top of that previous experience used from the Odin Project's teaching were used.

### How to run

- npm run build --> npm start --> Webpack dev server runs
- npm run send --> GitHub page updates
- npm test --> Jest tests run
